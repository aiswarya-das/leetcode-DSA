242. Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word,
using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Python Solution:

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # Count character frequencies in both strings and compare
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
