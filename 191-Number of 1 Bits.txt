191. Number of 1 Bits

Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation.
(This is also known as the Hamming weight.)

Example 1:
Input: n = 11
Output: 3

Explanation:
Binary representation of 11 is 1011, which has three set bits.

Python Solution:

class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n:
            res += n % 2     # Add 1 if the last bit is set
            n = n >> 1       # Right shift to process the next bit
        return res
