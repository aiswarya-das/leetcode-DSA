268. Missing Number

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range [0, n],
return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2

Explanation:
n = 3, so the full range is [0, 1, 2, 3].
2 is missing from the array.

Python Solution:

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)                    # Total number of elements
        s = n * (n + 1) // 2             # Sum of first n natural numbers (0 to n)
        res = s - sum(nums)             # Subtract actual sum from expected sum
        return res
